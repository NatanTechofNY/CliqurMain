				  		<p class = "col-md-10 about_p">Cliqur started out as a project for a hackathon at Princeton University. The original intention of building this platform was inspired from our own experiences. We as student understand how difficult it is communicate with the professor when there's more than thirty people sitting in the room, let alone  100+. We built the foundation of Cliqur on this central problem, and it has grown ever since. </p>

						     <p class = "col-md-10 about_p">We wanted to elimate the need for iClickers, which are used in schools all across the world. These days, everyone has access to either a laptop, tablet or smartphone practically all the time, which we used to our advantage. We redefined the clicker into something <b style = "color: #DD4A3B" >sleek </b>, <b style = "color: #2875B8">efficient </b> and <b style = "color: #ECAD24">convenient</b>, while also providing countless more features which can streamline the communication process. </p>

				  			<p class = "col-md-10 about_p">Cliqur allows instructors to create <b>virtual sessions</b> and invite students to participate by joining with a session ID. Students are able to ask questions, input multiple choice responses and visualize the results of the classroom performance. 
							On the other hand, instructors can take advantage of our neat attendance verification system, which lets the instructors print out a pre-formatted attendance sheet with accurate record of attendance for that session.</p>
						   
						   <p class = "col-md-10 about_p">Since it's creation, our team has been driven to make Cliqur into what we know it can be. Stay tuned for many new features and thanks for stopping by!</p>
